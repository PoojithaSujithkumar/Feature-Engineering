🛠️ Feature Engineering – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview  
This project was completed during my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The focus was on enhancing the dataset by creating meaningful features that can improve analysis and model performance.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant names, addresses, and service options
- Categorical features like "Table booking" and "Online delivery"

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Extracted new features:
   - Length of the restaurant name
   - Length of the address  
✅ Created encoded features:
   - `Has Table Booking` (binary flag)
   - `Has Online Delivery` (binary flag)  
✅ Cleaned and prepared the enhanced dataset for future use

📈 Results  
- Added informative, model-ready features  
- Simplified categorical columns through binary encoding  
- Enhanced the dataset’s structure for easier analysis

🚀 Key Learnings  
- Learned how to create and evaluate derived features  
- Understood the impact of thoughtful feature design on data usability  
- Gained practical experience in transforming real-world data

🌟 Acknowledgment  
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, where I am learning to prepare robust datasets for analysis and modeling.
